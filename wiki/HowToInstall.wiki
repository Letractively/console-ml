= Buttons information =

<p>LadyBird drop-down button gives you opportunity to save Entire log or just filtered log.</p>

<p>The Clear button clears the buffered log messages. When clicked, only new messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>Log drop-down lets you select a configured log, edit the selected log configuration, delete the selected log configuration, or create a new log configuration.</p>

<p>The Log drop-down lets you select a configured log, edit the selected log configuration, delete the selected log configuration, or create a new log configuration.</p>

<p>The Log levels pull down enables individual filters for each error class. For each enabled error class, a button appears to the right for that level (for example, licking on Info in the Log Levels drop-down will show an info button. Clicking the Info button shows all Informational messages.</p>

<p>The Level+ button enables display of multiple classes of messages at once. The drop-down to the right of Level+ lets you select multiple classes of messages to be displayed by the Level+ button. Selecting Into class in the drop-down, then clicking Level+ shows the same result as clicking the Info button.</p>

<p>Filter buttons (Finest, Finer, Fine, Debug, Config, Info , Warning, Notice, Error, Critical, Alert, Emergency). Clicking one will display only buffered messages of that type. These buttons are enabled or disabled using the Log levels drop-down.</p>

= Setting up a log configuration: =

<p>The <b>Log name</b> is only meaningful to the user. It is not, for example, the name of the error log file.</p>

<p>Next to the Log path text box is a help icon (balloon with a question mark) that shows some example paths). Type the full path to the current log file (C:\Program Files\MarkLogic\Data\Logs\ErrorLog.txt for Windows).</p>

<p>The Log URL in the remote Log configuration identifies a REST endpoint that will return a text Log file (The built in endpoint invocation is (e.g.) HTTP://localhost:8001/get-error-log.xqy?filename=ErrorLog.txt. This is will read the local log file. Substitute your remote host for “localhost” to read a remote log file.</p>

<p>Since ConsoleML will only show messages posted to the log since the plug-in was started (or since the clear button was clicked), it won’t work for log files that aren’t changing (like ErrorLog_1.txt).</p>
